I was born in the dark age of cybersecurity, in the hidden land of The Science Club. Before my birth, Mankind crafted a poisonous mix of beliefs and persuaded most of its inhabitants to drink it. The effect? A massive witchcraft! Under the spell of this evil potion people mistook ideas for white noise and a blind dogmatism about cybersecurity ruled Earth. The Science Club was one of the very few places where people were immune to such a spell, but they didn’t know why. I’m the one who found the antidote and saved us from ourselves.
